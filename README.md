# Agent Skills

A curated collection of **agent skills** for designers/builders using **Codex**, **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, and other AI coding agents to build rich user interfaces, frontend systems, agent loops, automations, and reusable workflows.

Use them with **Codex**, **Claude Design**, [**Aura Build**](https://aura.build), **Lovable**, and the rest of your agent stack.

Use these skills to turn references into prompts, then run those prompts in [Aura Build](https://aura.build) to generate detailed landing pages.

Start with the flagship web-design workflow:

1. **[Video to Super Prompt](agent-skills/codex/video-to-superprompt/SKILL.md)**
   Turns a screen recording of a design, landing page, or animation into a super detailed prompt that Fable 5 can use to one-shot HTML.
2. **[HTML to Interaction Prompts](agent-skills/codex/html-to-interaction-prompts/SKILL.md)**
   Turns an existing HTML page, like an Aura Build page, into reusable prompts for one section, one animation, one button, one hover state, or one WebGL effect.
3. **[Stitched Full Page Capture](agent-skills/codex/stitched-full-page-capture/SKILL.md)**
   Captures the entire landing page instead of only the hero, giving your agent a full-page reference for structure, pacing, and visual hierarchy.
4. **[Daily UI Inspiration](agent-skills/codex/daily-ui-inspiration-capture/SKILL.md)**
   Combines browsing, capture, reference study, and prompt generation into a useful agent loop that turns strong landing pages into detailed prompt packs.

These are Clawdbot-style skill folders: concise `SKILL.md` playbooks with optional references, articles, scripts, and assets. The goal is simple: turn good prompts, workflows, style systems, capture recipes, and debugging habits into versioned files an agent can load and follow.

Portable by default. Each skill should work for any user, repo, or workspace unless the user supplies project-specific context through local agent instructions.

Use these skills when you want:
- repeatable design direction
- procedural implementation steps
- copy/paste snippets
- common pitfalls and guardrails
- reusable workflows instead of one-off chat answers

## Agent support

The format is intentionally plain Markdown and folder-based.

- **Codex**: load the relevant `SKILL.md` before acting. Repo behavior belongs in `AGENTS.md`; browser work in this repo should use the Codex browser.
- **Claude Code**: reference the relevant skill from `CLAUDE.md`, copy it into a Claude skills setup, or open the `SKILL.md` directly as working context.
- **Cursor**: point Cursor rules or chat context at the specific skill folder. Keep reusable snippets, constraints, and defaults easy to paste.
- **Other agents**: use the same contract: read the narrowest matching skill first, then follow its steps and linked references.

## Philosophy

### 1) Prompts are assets
If it’s good once, it should be reusable.
- store prompts as files
- version them
- build libraries + stylecards

### 2) Specs beat vibes
The fastest way to consistent output is:
- clear constraints
- clear hierarchy
- “change 1–2 things only” iteration

### 3) References beat paragraphs
Screenshots and examples carry:
- fonts, spacing, colors
- layout rhythm
- icon style

### 4) Skills are operating procedures
Good skills tell the agent exactly when to use them, what to do first, what defaults to apply, and what mistakes to avoid.

Folder contract:

  SKILL.md            # required: frontmatter + workflow
  REFERENCES.md       # optional: links only
  ARTICLE.md          # optional: long-form explanation
  assets/             # optional: images, templates, examples
  scripts/            # optional: helper scripts
```

Conventions:
- `SKILL.md` is the skill an agent loads and follows.
- `REFERENCES.md` is links only. Keep `SKILL.md` lean.
- Keep skills **procedural** (steps, patterns, guardrails), not encyclopedic.
- Prefer explicit triggers: "Use when..." beats vague descriptions.
- Prefer defaults: durations, spacing, hierarchy, commands, and acceptance checks.

## How to add a new skill (workflow)

1) Create a folder:
- `agent-skills/<category>/<skill-name>/`

2) Add `SKILL.md`:
- frontmatter: `name`, `description`
- content: when to use, workflow, pitfalls, recipes, what to ask

3) (Optional) add `REFERENCES.md`:
- doc links only

4) Test the skill contract:
- clear trigger
- concrete workflow
- reusable snippets or commands
- pitfalls and acceptance checks
- no secrets or private client info

5) Commit:
- small commits per skill
- clear message, usually `Add <skill-name> skill` or `Update <skill-name> skill`

---

## Writing style

- Write like Meng To: skimmable, practical, confident.
- Prefer constraints and defaults.
- Avoid fluff.
- Keep long explanations in `ARTICLE.md`, not `SKILL.md`.
- Keep references in `REFERENCES.md`, not the workflow.

---

## Maintenance ideas

- Keep category README files current as the library grows.
- Add install notes for Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor once the preferred setup is stable.
- Add lightweight validation for required frontmatter.
- Keep imported skills portable: no secrets, no private paths, no hidden account assumptions.
